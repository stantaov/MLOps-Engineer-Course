# The Machine Learning DevOps Engineer 

The Nanodegree program aims to facilitate the process of integrating machine learning models and deploying them in a production-level environment using the best DevOps practices.

## Projects

[Predict Customer Churn]()  

This project identifyes credit card customers that are most likely to churn. The project includes a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested).

[Build an ML Pipeline for Short-term Rental Prices in NYC]()  

In this project, the goal is to assist a property management company that rents rooms and properties for short periods on various rental platforms. The objective is to estimate the typical price of a given property by analyzing the prices of similar properties. The company receives new data in bulk every week, requiring the model to be retrained at the same frequency. To accommodate this need, an end-to-end pipeline must be developed and implemented, allowing for efficient reuse and model retraining.

[Deploying a Machine Learning Model on Heroku with FastAPI]()  

In this project, the focus is on developing a classification model based on Census Bureau data, with the primary objective of deploying a robust machine learning model into production.

Key aspects of the project include:

-   Utilizing Data Version Control (DVC) for versioning both data and models.
-   Implementing pytest for code testing.
-   Employing the FastAPI package for model deployment and creating API tests on Heroku.
-   Integrating the machine learning pipeline into a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) framework using GitHub Actions.

[ML Model Scoring and Monitoring]()  

In this project, the focus is on addressing various scoring processes that occur after model deployment, including model drift and determining if models require retraining and redeployment. The project tackles challenges related to data integrity, stability issues, timing concerns, and dependency management.
